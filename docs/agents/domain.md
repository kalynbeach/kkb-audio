# Domain docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repository's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repository root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repository root if it exists. It points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, proceed silently. Don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them when terms or decisions get resolved.

## File structure

This repository uses a single-context layout:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│   └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name, use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary, reconsider whether you're inventing language the project doesn't use. If the gap is real, note it for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, state the conflict instead of silently overriding it:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because..._
