# `kkb-audio`

A Rust foundation for KKB sound, audio, and music software. The long-term system will share a portable render engine across web, native, and offline hosts while keeping host-specific lifecycle, media, and device concerns outside the real-time core.

## Status

The project is in focused render-engine validation. Milestone 1 implements a private offline kernel:

```text
mono sine oscillator -> linked scalar gain -> mono or semantic L/R planar output
```

Its tests establish frame and phase semantics, partition-independent output, bounded capacity behavior, checked clock handling, and no observed allocator calls in the exercised render path. There is no public engine API or playback application yet.

See the canonical [system architecture](docs/2026-08-28-kkb-audio-system-architecture.md) and [initial validation plan](docs/2026-08-29-initial-render-engine-validation-plan.md).

## Development

The repository pins stable Rust 1.98.
